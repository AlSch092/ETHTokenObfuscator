# ETHTokenObfuscator
A centralized web application to re-direct ethereum token transactions to middle wallets before reaching a destination. Similar concept to tornado cash with different inner workings.

Code needs to be re-written very badly, was in a rush when doing it.

The node running this application must have an SQLExpress instance installed, alternatively you can change the code to use a file instead of a database depending on your user load expected.
